    <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>

    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platofrim,
      object-oriented scripting language.
      JavaScript is extremely popular for a
      variety of reasons. It is a small and lighweight
       language allowing maximum flexibility for
       developers to take it in a bunch of different directions.
       JavaScript lives inside a host enviroment (a web browser or
       Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these
       enviroments to provide programmtic control over them.</p>

       <ul link="#06c5e2">
             <li><p><a href="">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique means. These unique names are called identifiers. <span>var x;</span></p></li>
             <li><p><a href="">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving out variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x = 10;</span></p></li>
             <li><p><a href="">Data Type</a> Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables, you need to know the data type. These are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null - <span>null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159;</span> String - <span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> and Object - <span >{first_name: 'Donovan', last_name:'An'}</span></p></li>
             <li><p><a href="">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplis this. There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span>else </span> we execute this block of code.</p></li>
             <li><p><a href="">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</p></li>
             <li><p><a href="">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call out function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again.</p></li>
        </ul>
